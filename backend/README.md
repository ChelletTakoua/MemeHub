# MemeHub Back-end

This is the backend for the MEMEHUB project. It is a PHP RESTful API that provides the necessary endpoints for the frontend to interact with the database.




## Project Structure


### index.php:
index.php is the entry point of the application. It handles all incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate controller based on the request method and URL.

### Router:
The [Router](src/Router.php) class is responsible for managing the routes of the application. It allows to add routes with different methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS) and matches the current url with the routes and execute the callable function of the matched route.
You can find the routes in the [routes.php](src/routes.php) file. Each route is defined with a method, a path, and a callable function (a method of a controller).

### Controllers:
Controllers are responsible for handling requests and returning responses. Each controller is associated with a specific endpoint and is responsible for processing requests to that endpoint.

### Models:
Models represent entities in the database. Each model corresponds to a table in the database and contains methods for interacting with that table.
Models don't have a logic on their own. They are structures that represent entities from the database. Any logic or treatment on these objects is implemented in other classes like Controllers. 

### TableManagers:
TableManagers are responsible for managing the interaction between the backend and the database. They contain methods for performing CRUD operations on the database.

### Utils:
Utils contains utility classes that are used throughout the application.

### Config:
Config contains configuration files for the application.



## Other Classes and Files:
    
- **DatabaseConnection.php:**
        Responsible for establishing a connection to the database.
- **autoload.php:**
    Autoloads all classes in the project.
- **headers.php:**
    Sets the headers for the response.
- **jwt.php:**
    Handles JWT token generation and validation.








### JSON Server and related features:
The choice to employ a JSON server as a backend stemmed from the need to create a database-like structure. It's a swift solution as the server handles most logic, eliminating the need for extensive database management. Additionally, its setup is more user-friendly for anyone attempting to use the application.


- **Testing Json-server:**  
  A test runs upon application startup to verify the JSON server's status. Created a unique test endpoint named "ECommerceProjectTestEndPoint" to identify my server, preventing conflicts on the specified port. I'm sure there are cleaner solutions, but this is the one I came up with!


- **Type Adapters:**   
  I used [Type Adapters](src/adapters) to convert JSON objects to Java objects and vice-versa. This approach is more flexible than using the Gson library's default implementation, allowing for more control over the conversion process.


- **GsonInstance:**  
  I created a [GsonInstance](src/adapters/GsonInstance.java) class holding a static preconfigured Gson object to avoid creating multiple Gson objects throughout the application and configuring them every time. This approach is more efficient and allows for easier manipulation of the Gson object.


- **Proxy:**  
  I used a [Proxy](src/adapters/Proxy.java) class to handle objects with foreign keys in the database. This class is responsible for fetching the foreign object from the database on first use. This approach is more efficient than fetching the foreign object every time it's needed.


- **QueryParamsBuilder:**  
  Developed a [QueryParamsBuilder](src/helpers/QueryParamsBuilder.java) to facilitate HTTPS request creation.


- **API_URLs Handling:**  
  Opted to define API_URLs in the DatabaseService parent class instead of separate subclasses, facilitating easier manipulation and grouping constants together.


- **Filtered https requests:**  
  Simple filters are implemented by a simple query parameter in the URL. However, due to limitations in checking for null or applying conditions in query parameters for the JSON server, more complex filters are implemented by fetching all objects and filtering them locally. This approach is less efficient, but it's the only way to implement more complex filters.


- **Null values in JSON:**   
  I chose wrapper classes over primitive types to support null values for non essential fields


- **Data generation:**  
  I used various methods to create the JSON database, focusing on the products section. I started with the base structure from [DummyJson](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products) and expanded it by including extra details for specific categories using chatGPT. After that, I fine-tuned the values manually to align the database with my project's needs.  
  Additionally, I employed a json-Generator tool available online at https://json-generator.com/. Some data, such as serial numbers, was generated by the application itself, while other information was created using specific scripts I developed.


### Console UI:
The console UI is designed to be as user-friendly as possible, with a simple and intuitive interface.
- **Page System:**   
  see [Page System Overview](#page-system-overview) section.


- **ConsoleHelper:**  
  The [ConsoleHelper](src/helpers/ConsoleHelper.java) class is responsible for handling all console-related operations, including input and output.


- **ConsoleColors:**  
  The [ConsoleColors](src/helpers/ConsoleColors.java) class holds constants for various console colors, for a more colorful and visually appealing user interface.


- **TableLayout:**  
  The [TableLayout](src/helpers/TableLayout.java) class is responsible for displaying data in a table format. It accepts a list of columns and a list of rows to display. The TableLayout class automatically adjusts the column width to fit the data and displays the table in a visually appealing format.

### Page System Overview:

The Page System within this project manages the user interface flow by organizing pages using a stack structure. Each time a user navigates to a new page, it's added to the top of the stack. This stack-based approach allows for easy navigation between pages and maintains a history of visited pages.

- **Action Menu Integration:**    
  The [ActionMenu](src/helpers/ActionMenu.java) class is responsible for managing multiple-choice menus within the application. It accepts an array of actions to display and prompts the user for input (the index of the desired action) to execute the corresponding action. This system is extensively used across various pages within the application.
    - The ActionMenu also includes a closing action, often used to return to the previous page. This functionality simplifies navigation, especially for pages not calling other pages directly.

    - The abstract BackOnlyPage class utilizes the ActionMenu by automatically presenting a minimal menu with just the closing action. This kind of page is useful for displaying information without invoking other pages and simplifies the process of returning to the previous page.


- **Access Levels:**   
  Each page has an access level that determines which users can access it. The access level is checked upon page creation, and if the user doesn't have the required access level (a scenario that shouldn't occur), they are redirected to the previous page. This approach is useful for restricting access to pages based on user roles.

### Authentication System:
- **email validation:**  
  The email validation is done by a regex pattern. The pattern is not perfect, but it's good enough for this project.
  The email is stored in the database in lowercase to avoid case sensitivity issues.


- **Password encryption:**  
  Passwords are encrypted using an encryption algorithm to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts. The encrypted password is stored in the database instead of the original password. For simplicity, the crypt function just returns the password as is to simplify testing, but in a real-world scenario, it would encrypt the password.


- **CAPTCHA System:**  
  A [CAPTCHA system](src/helpers/CaptchaTest.java) is implemented to prevent brute force attacks on the login page and to prevent bots from purchasing products. The CAPTCHA Test requires the user to solve a simple math problem to proceed.

### Products:
- **Product Categories:**  
  Products are saved in the database in the same table, but they are separated into categories and each category has a different set of attributes. The category is saved in the database as a string.
  The [ProductAdapter](src/adapters/ProductAdapter.java) uses the category attribute to determine the correct class to parse the product to.


- **Product Stock:**  
  Products have a quantity attribute that is updated when a product is purchased.


- **Serial Numbers**  
  For products that support serial numbers, each instance of the product has a unique serial number. The serial number is generated automatically when a new stock is registered for a product.


- **Product Reviews:**  
  Products can have reviews. Each review has a rating and a comment. The rating is an integer between 1 and 5.


- **Product Wishlist:**  
  Users can add products to their wishlist. The wishlist is saved in the database as a list of product IDs.


- **Other Product Attributes:**  
  Products can have another set of custom attributes regardless of their category. These attributes are represented in the database as a JSON object and parsed to a HashMap in the application.


## Conclusion

This project was a valuable learning experience, covering aspects like GitHub commands, JSON server usage, and project structuring.
I have numerous original ideas that I'm enthusiastic about implementing in this project. Due to upcoming exams, I need to prioritize my studies over further development of this project
