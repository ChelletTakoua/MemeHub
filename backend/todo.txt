added general infrastructure ( router, autoload, httpException handling, etc. )

- structure the project in a way that it is extendable and easy to maintain
- add a readme file that explains how to run the project


-maybe add autoloader

-add database classes

-this is how the database classes should be structured:
    - A DatabaseConnection Class that will handle the connection to the database ( getConnection() )
    - A DatabaseQuery Class that will handle the queries to the database ( select(), insert(), update(), delete() )
    - classes for each table in the database that will extend the DatabaseQuery class and will have the table name as a property
